# Project Proposal - Unsupervised Learning

I have scraped Bitcoin news websites to obtain several thousand news articles. I will perform topic modeling in order to understand and visualize the prevalence and the sentiment of the various topics over time. I will also perform sentiment analysis on Reddit data (from the r/Bitcoin subreddit) using TextBlob and/or VADER. 

I will combine daily sentiment scores from news articles and Reddit with traditional numerical representations of sentiment and activity in the Bitcoin community. This will serve as a starting point for clustering individual days into groups. The goal will be to define clusters that represent different states of global sentiment in the Bitcoin community.

All of this information will be organized into interactive dashboards that allow the user to get a sense of sentiment at a given time (and in the past) and to track topic sentiment and prevalence over time.
